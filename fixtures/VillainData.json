One-on-one, artillery has a good chance of defeating a single hero, under optimal circumstances.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Artillery is accomplished at detecting and identifying targets, and proficient in the skills needed to move around. As such, they have Level + 3 ranks in Concentration, Knowledge (pick one), and Notice, and Level ranks in Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, and Swim. Depending upon their style, they may have one or two additional skills (such as Knowledge (supernatural) or Survival).</p><p><b>Combat:</b> Artillery has exceptional ranged combat skill. When making ranged attacks use the Primary Attack number. The Secondary Attack is for melee attacks. Likewise, the Defense numbers in parentheses are used when avoiding melee attack -- the larger numbers are for avoiding ranged attacks.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> Artillery relies upon their own deadly skill, and the distance and obstacles between them and their targets, to defeat their foes. The listed feats and abilities should allow that to happen.</p><p><em>Widen Attack:</em> The artillery can widen its basic damage attack (as the Widen Power feat) the listed times per encounter. This may be an enhanced power, specialized grenades, a hail of arrows, or some other special variation on their normal attack. (The limited usage is simply to prevent over-use, since such powerful area attacks quickly drain heroic resources. If you really need more uses, then have them; seriously consider granting a Conviction point to affected heroes.)</p><p><b>Damage:</b> This column is the artillery\u2019s attack-form damage bonus.

            "description": "<p>The war leader is a field commander, a leader of troops and a commanding presence on any battlefield. Some inspire their followers through praise and leadership while others use threats and fear. The most dangerous tend to be honorable and noble, but the numbers they can bring and their dedication to dominance make them implacable foes and dangerous politicians.</p><p>Don\u2019t confuse a war leader with a villain that simply attracts followers. Though of moderate power on his own, a war leader uses his followers to even the odds against the party. Other villains may use thugs and footsoldiers but the war leader depends upon them.</p><p><b>Level:</b> A war leader of the indicated level is a good challenge for a party of about four heroes of that level. One-on-one, a war leader has a good chance of defeating a single hero, under optimal circumstances.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> War leaders are as varied in their skills as they are in their methods of influence. That said, certain skills are a given. The war leader has Level + 3 ranks in Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (any one), and Ride. The war leader is also keenly aware of the flow of battle, having Level ranks in Notice.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> War leader feats focus on personal combat and an overpowering presence.<ul><li><em>Canny Dodge:</em> The war leader is a powerful presence, and adds his Charisma as a dodge/parry bonus to his Defense. Despite the war leader\u2019s particular trappings, this bonus applies. This does not apply to foes immune to Fear effects.</li><li><em>Swift Intimidate:</em> The war leader can use the Demoralize use of Intimidate once per round as a Free action.</li><li><em>Battle Leader:</em> The war leader has a number of followers (minions), which is as large or as small as the Narrator needs it to be. A guideline is to use followers equal to \u00bd war leader level + 2. Additionally, each time he gains Battle Leader he chooses another one of the following abilities.<ul><li><em>Awesome Reputation:</em> A tide of victory, a ferocious reputation, or tactical acumen armors his followers. All followers within hearing of the war leader gain a bonus to their dodge/parry defense equal to the war leader\u2019s Charisma. This bonus is lost when dodge defense would be lost.</li><li><em>Devoted Followers:</em> Through his personal charm and carefull y perfected ability to manipulate the weak but ambitious, the war leader has groomed his followers into a fighting force trained to protect him at all costs. Any of the war leader\u2019s allies within 30 feet of him who have fewer Levels than he has can take actions to defend him. Whenever the war leader\u2019s allies with fewer Levels than his own use the aid another standard action to improve his defense or give him a bonus to attacks, they grant a +4 bonus.</li><li><em>Domineering Thug:</em> The war leader is at his best when he fights weak, inferior foes who can\u2019t hope to match his prowess. He gains a +1 bonus to attacks and damage against foes that have fewer Levels than he has. He loses this benefit if he takes a Wounded or worse condition.</li><li><em>Field Commander:</em> Once per round during an ally\u2019s action, a war leader can grant a bonus equal to his Charisma to an ally\u2019s skill check, defense, or saving throw. This all y must be within 30 feet of the war leader.</li><li><em>Frenzied Commander:</em> If the war leader has no followers either remaining or with him, he may use a standard action to make two attacks. These attacks are at the war leader\u2019s full attack bonus, and are rolled separately. If the attacks target the same creature then they damage is combined, as Combined Attacks, or Two-Weapon Fighting.</li><li><em>Fury Breeds Strength:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can fill his allies with rage. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. Subjects gain the benefits and drawbacks of the Rage feat for a number of rounds equal to the war leader\u2019s level. The fatigue from the rage lasts an equal amount of time. Unwilling allies get a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + \u00bd level + Cha) to resist.</li><li><em>Grunt Wall:</em> If the war leader is adjacent to an ally who has fewer Level than he has, he can use that ally as cover against ranged attacks. As a move action, the war leader chooses an ally as the target of this ability. The war leader gains complete cover against ranged attacks if his chosen ally is the same size or larger than him. This benefit lasts until the start of the war leader\u2019s next action. It also ends if the chosen grunt drops or moves so that she is no longer adjacent to the war leader.\t</li><li><em>Guardian Squad:</em> If the war leader stands adjacent to an ally who has fewer Levels than he has, he can use that ally as a shield. As a move action, the war leader chooses a single ally as the target of this ability. When the war leader suffers an attack, treat the ally as if she were the target of the attack. This ability immediately ends if the war leader\u2019s chosen ally drops or moves so that she is no longer adjacent to the war leader.</li><li><em>Lead from the Rear:</em> Once per encounter, the war leader can change his initiative score to 20 + his initiative modifiers if he does nothing this turn but move away from his opponents. The war leader must choose to use this ability at the end of the current round.</li><li><em>Leadership Inspires Greatness:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can give all allies that can see or hear him a +2 bonus to attack and damage.</li><li><em>Legends Inspire Awe:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can overcome foes with his presence. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. The subjects must make a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + \u00bd level + Cha). Upon failure they are dazed (taking no action, but defending normally) for one round. On each of the following rounds, subjects can make a Will save (with a cumulative +1 bonus for each save) to shake off their awe and act normally.</li><li><em>Legends Inspire Fear:</em> Once per encounter, as a move action, the war leader can overwhelm foes with fear. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. The subjects must make a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + \u00bd level + Cha). If they fail, they are shaken and suffer a \u20132 penalty to attack rolls, checks, and saving throws (except Toughness saves). If the save fails by 5 or more, they are panicked and flee from him as quickly as possible.</li><li><em>Signature Strike:</em> Along the path of legend, the war leader learned a signature attack. Up to once per four levels, the war leader can use a full-round action to make his signature attack. As part of this attack, he can move up to half his speed as if using the Move-By Action feat. If the attack hits, it is a critical threat. Additionally, he gets his Charisma as a bonus on the confirmation roll.</li><li><em>Success Breeds Weakness:</em> The war leader can turn the most powerful of heroes into bumbling fools. Once per encounter, as a standard action, the war leader can turn a character\u2019s heroic potential against them. This counts as an interaction skill even though no check is required. The subjects must make a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + \u00bd level + Cha). Failure causes the target to take a penalty to all attacks and checks until the end of the encounter. The penalty is equal to the target\u2019s Conviction total. This penalty decreases as the character spends Conviction and increases as they regain it.</li><li><em>WAAAGH!:</em> With a thunderous cry, the war leader can drive all his followers into battle. Once per encounter, as a standard action, he may grant all allies that can he can interact with an immediate standard action. This action must be used to make a charge attack. Hesitant allies get a Will Save (Difficulty 10 + \u00bd level + Cha) to resist the compulsion.</li></ul></li></ul><p><b>Damage:</b> War leaders are warriors of great skill. They have a basic damaging attack that can represent claws, swords, warhammers, magical auras, kung-fu, or just about any other appropriate description.</p><p><b>Toughness:</b> War leaders get a bonus to their toughness based upon level. This can represent just about any mostly-permanent effect, from armor to feats, to natural armor, to protective enchantments.</p><p><b>Size:</b> War leaders can be any size, though medium is the most common. Generally, don\u2019t adjust the war leader\u2019s abilities, toughness, or combat when changing size.</p>",

Creating barriers, deploying traps and snares, causing deceptions and distractions, and generally wreaking havoc upon movement and coordination is the controller\u2019s specialty. Sometimes, you want a \u201ccontroller\u201d that enhances his allies rather than altering the field; for such characters look to the War Leader role.</p><p>This role can represent abjurers, conjurers, illutionists, transmuters, and even enchanters. For no/low-magic settings it can represent specialized grenades, trick arrows, sonic emitter cannons, or any of a dozen other methods for deploying discontent and confusion across a battlefield.</p><p><b>Level:</b> A controller of the indicated level is a good challenge for a party of about four heroes of that level. One-on-one, a controller has a good chance of defeating a single hero, under optimal circumstances.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Controllers are as varied in their skills as they are in their trappings. That said, certain skills are a given. The controller has Level + 3 ranks in Concentration, Knowledge (any two), and one interaction skill. Up to three additional skills may be had as appropriate to the character\u2019s style and trappings (e.g. Handle Animal and Survival for shaman villains).</p><p><b>Feats:</b> Controllers have few actual feats, relying instead upon their special abilities to hamper and manipulate their foes. Most feats are associated with their trappings. These generally have no combat effects.</p><p><b>Battlefield Mastery:</b> Each time the controller gains this, select one of the following abilities. The area of effect for the abilities is a radius of 5 ft per controller level, no more than 300 ft away. Each ability takes a standard action to activate. If it has duration longer than instant, it lasts for maintenance plus 3 rounds. Maintaining masteries takes a free action, just like maintaining powers; each distinct mastery active adds +2 to the Difficulty of any concentration checks required. Each mastery can be used an unlimited number of times; however, no more than four of the same effect should be active at the same time.</p><p>Feel free to modify each mastery in ways appropriate to the trappings. Perhaps a barrier of fire deals damage to anything passing through it, rather than actually stopping it. A smoke cloud of magical darkness can be penetrated by darkvision. A distracting totem of a lust-inducing illusion requires a Will save. Et cetera.<ul><li><em>Bad Ground:</em> The target area becomes almost impassable. The terrain becomes very difficult, reducing movement speed through the area to one-quarter.</li><li><em>Barrier:</em> The controller creates a \u2018wall\u2019 that stops most movement and objects. The wall is 5 ft high and (10 ft per level) long. The wall may be arranged in any contiguous fashion. The wall can be broken (Toughness 5 + \u00bd level) as an object.</li><li><em>Distracting Totem:</em> The controller creates an area that seriously hampers his foes. Each creature in the area must make a Fortitude save or be sickened. Failure by 5 or more causes a nauseated condition. Failure by 10 or more makes the victim helpless. The victims can recover, getting a new save each round outside the effect, with a +1 per previous save.</li><li><em>Entangling Field:</em> Using appropriate trappings (vines, quicksand, webs, electro-nets, etc) the controller makes an area impassable. All characters in the area must make a Reflex save. Characters that fail are entangled. Failure by 5 or more leaves the character bound and helpless. Characters can escape via Escape Artist (Difficulty 15 + level) or by damaging the restraints (Toughness 1 + \u00bc level), which are an object. Characters entering the area must also make a Reflex save, as above. Characters only need to save once per entrance.</li><li><em>Fatigue:</em> The controller creates an area that drains the energy from characters. Characters in the target area must make a Fortitude save or become Winded. Failure by 5 causes the character to become Fatigued. Failure by 10 makes the character Exhausted. Failure by 15 or more renders the victim Unconscious. This is an instant effect. Victims can recover from this unnatural fatigue with only a minute of rest. Ten minutes of rest automatically removes all conditions caused by this ability.</li><li><em>Gravity:</em> The controller effectively increases the gravity in an area. Victims must make a Strength check or be slowed. Failure by 5 pushes the victim to the ground, making them prone and slowed. Victims that fail by 10 are prone and must make another check to take any action at all.</li><li><em>Illusion:</em> The controller generates a believable, but false, image in the area. Characters that interact with it may make a Will save to detect its illusory nature. The illusion cannot actually alter the area, though it can be perceived to do so. See the Illusion power for various modifiers and conditions on the will save.</li><li><em>Mass Slick:</em> An area of unstable terrain (ice, minor earthquakes, grease, etc) trips all within. Characters in or entering the area must make a Reflex save or fall prone. Standing characters in the area at the beginning of their turn must also make a save.</li><li><em>Smoke Cloud:</em> The controller can create an area that blocks visual senses. All vision through the area is blocked, blinding characters within the area.</li><li><em>Thunderclap:</em> Using appropriate means, the controller can temporarily blind and deafen foes. Characters in the area must make a Reflex save or be unable to see and hear. Each round the victim makes a Fortitude save to recover, with a +1 per previous fortitude save. This is an instant effect. Victims immune to Fortitude saves recover automatically, on their turn.</li><li><em>Weather</em>: The controller makes the environment itself distracting in the target area. Using appropriate means, the area becomes distracting, forcing a Concentration check (Difficulty 10 + level) from characters attempting any sort of focused activity.</li></ul><p><b>Difficulty:</b> This is the difficulty of any non-damage saving throws required by the controller\u2019s abilities. The controller\u2019s Intelligence has been factored into this number (so if you change the Int, or use another key ability, change the Difficulty). If another check is called for, and no Difficulty is given, then use this column.</p><p><b>Damage:</b> Controllers don\u2019t rely upon their damaging attacks; however, sometimes you just need something to cause damage. This attack has a range increment of 20 feet and goes out to 10 increments. It is generally used to finish targets trapped by other abilities.</p><p><b>Size:</b> Controllers can be any size, though medium is the most common.

            "description": "<p>The skirmisher is the proof of the power of mobility. Skirmishers not only refuse to stay still, they lose out greatly by not moving. Skirmishers are generally wary of large groups of opponents, due to the risk of being hemmed in and unable to move fast enough. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>This role is ideal for many animalistic predators (cheetah, eagles, and others that rely upon speed), dervish nomads, shadow-dancing rogues, hit-and-run drakes, and classic swinging-from-the-rigging swashbucklers. If the opponent moves fast, and uses that momentum to strike hard, then the skirmisher role is the one you want.</p><p><b>Level:</b> A skirmisher of the indicated level is a good challenge for a party of about four heroes of that level. One-on-one, a skirmisher has a good chance of defeating a single hero, under optimal circumstances.</p><p><b>Skills:</b> Skirmishers are all about movement. They have Level + 3 ranks in Acrobatics, Climb, Jump, and Stealth. Additional skills can be swapped in (or even added) to better reflect a specific concept. Keep in mind the movement penalties to Stealth.</p><p><b>Feats:</b> Skirmisher feats are related to their movement. Precise Shot negates a penalty, making it easier to run them. They also get a specialty feat:</p><ul><li><em>Fast Overrun:</em> As Great Cleave, for overruns. As long as you have sufficient movement, and continue to succeed at overrun, you can continue to make overrun attempts until you run out of movement or miss an attempt. You can change directions between attempts but must move at least 10 feet before each attempt.</li></ul></p><p><b>Combat:</b> Skirmishers benefit from mobility. If a skirmisher moves at least 30' in a round, they use the Primary Attack value for their attack rolls, and the higher Defense rolls. A skirmisher who does not jump about uses the Secondary Attack value for their attack rolls, and avoids attacks with the lower Defense values. Skirmishers also make use of the Defensive Roll feat -- a Skirmisher who is flat-footed can only use its Constitution for its Toughness roll.</p><p><b>Damage:</b> This column is the Skirmisher\u2019s base attack-form damage. If the damage form is a ranged attack, treat it as having a range of 30 feet. </p><p><b>Abilities:</b> Skirmishers of the indicated levels have the indicated ability scores.</p><p><b>Speed:</b> Skirmishers are fast. Add 10' to their speed for each \"Improved Speed\" feat they have (starting with a base speed of 30').</p>",
